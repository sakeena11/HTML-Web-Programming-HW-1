	<h3> My Baking Journey </h3>
	
	<p> 
		I have been baking for my whole life. It started out when I was a little girl, helping my mom mash the bananas <br>
		for banana bread and add the chocolate chips for cookies. As I got older, I started try new things on my own, <br>
		so it moved on to different flavored cookies, cupcakes, and my first not so pretty cakes. At the end of 2020, <br>
		I decided I wanted to make a birthday cake for my brother's birthday in January. For the entire month of December, <br>
		I researched all the tools and ingredients I would need, watched endless tutorials, and planned every step I would <br>
		take. The actual process of make the cake was very long, but also rewarding. It ended up turning out really well, <br>
		so I made the goal to make all of my family member's cakes for the year of 2020.
	</p>
		
	<h3> What I Learned </h3>
	
	<p> 
		In the year 2020, I ended up making 7 different cakes. During each process I experimented with different flavors <br>
		and techniques, and found myself getting more confident in my skills. Each time I made a cake, I would estimate the <br>
		amount of time it took me to prepare all the components, as well as the decoration process, and I found that for <br>
		each cake, the time I spent would decrease. In January 2022, I experienced a full circle moment when I baked the same <br>
		brother another birthday cake. It was a complete one year journey, and when I look back, I see how much I have progressed, <br>
		not just in baking, but also with the willingness to take risks and try new things!
	</p>
	
	<h3> What the Future Holds </h3>
	
	<p> 
		During 2021, I was baking a new cake about every two months, and I found myself really enjoying it and wanting to try <br>
		new things! I considered opening a business, and even created a baking Instagram account called Sweets By Sakeena. <br>
		After a lot of deliberation, I realized that creating a small may not be the best idea since it would take a lot of time <br>
		and effort, and I was very focused on school. I still really like the idea of one day creating a business, but for the <br>
		time being, I just bake for my friends and family whenever I can!
